To Do List
-Need to test Aquarius UTC offset, see if it can accept 07:00. If it can, this will help for those weird offsets of 05:30
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
-Create private query, add Aquarius to this
    -
-Fix last quick look not working
-Logging and debugging, best practices
-Query list has a typo in query









-non data dictionary dataID should still run through missing and repeating

####### TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Query window sized needs to stay fixed, basically no max button
-Table first column doesn't adjust size to fit data AND header after clicking header to sort. Header is truncated on SDID 1721. Also can't resize header after sorting like that
-Add refresh button to reset table sort
-Export to CSV is seperating timestamps, it's using date,time. Need to export them in a single column, seperated by a space
-DataDictionary table needs to auto size columns

To Do List
-Need to test Aquarius UTC offset, see if it can accept 07:00. If it can, this will help for those weird offsets of 05:30
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json
-Aquarius query seems to take longer than it should. Look at possible threading solutions
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end

-Logging and debugging, best practices
-Info buttons on query windows is too high on Windows systems

-Stress relief button that makes screaming goat sounds

-Add in some quick time changes from 48 hours and 7 days
    -Two day set to beginning of previous day to current day current hour








-non data dictionary dataID should still run through missing and repeating

####### QUERY INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Fix last quick look not working
-Quick looks errong after save, but will eventually show up in the combobox, but you can't load them. I think both of these are tied to loading
-Internal query list box needs to be wider



####### DATA TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Query window sized needs to stay fixed, basically no max button
-Table first column doesn't adjust size to fit data AND header after clicking header to sort. Header is truncated on SDID 1721. Also can't resize header after sorting like that
-Add refresh button to reset table sort
-Export to CSV is seperating timestamps, it's using date,time. Need to export them in a single column, seperated by a space
-SDID with MRID in them are not running through data dictionary properly, which means they are not getting proper headers


####### DATA DICTIONARY TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-DataDictionary table needs to auto size columns
-DataDictionary needs sort, similar to the date table sort
-Buttons need to run through button logic

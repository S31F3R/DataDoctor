####### HOUSE KEEPING #######
-Remove color mode as a user.config item
-Logging and debugging, best practices
    -Any current [DEBUG] after an exception should be a ERROR and logged, no matter if DEBUG = true
-Save dialog for CSV needs wider columns or auto size needs to be fixed
-Need an option to change font size in the program

####### NEW FEATURES #######
-Create a plot tool that allows users to build different data plots and save that plot config as a quick look
    -This can be done with below parker/davis stretch also. Create a plot that finds travel times in a given stretch, based on user input. Below parker or davis would be saved as quick looks in this tool

-Export to CSV needs work. Remembering path isn't working across platform, possibly Qt issue. Lots of trial and error code left in there, needs to be removed when completed
-Raw data option not working

####### MAIN INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Stress relief button that makes screaming goat sounds
-Add to current button style, hover and press effects

####### QUERY WINDOW MODIFICATIONS #######
-Change quick look save text box into a q line edit
-When the user hits add query and the query list gets too long and requires a scroll bar, make the list scroll to the bottom so user can see new entry
-Create a search icon next to dataID, this will need to bring up a window with a search. Allow user to search data dictionary, then hit add to query
    -Search will need a combobox to allow the user to search by dataID, label, or database

####### QUERY ENHANCMENTS MODIFICATIONS #######
-Update INSTANT interval to include 1, 15, or 60 minute instant intervals
    -Pass the different intervals as INSTANT-15, INSTANT-60 etc
    -Can remove USBR quirk of INSTANT always being HOUR interval whent his is implemented
-Aquarius query seems to take longer than it should. Look at possible threading solutions
    -If increasing Aquarius threads, make it an option to set how many threads can be used
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end    
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json
-non data dictionary dataID should still run through missing and repeating
-modify and test for day, month, year, and water year queries
-See if there is a better way to get around unverified cert when using HTTPS on Aquarius query

####### DATA TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Aquairus headers need to be label /n location /n uid
-Table first column doesn't adjust size to fit data AND header after clicking header to sort. Header is truncated on SDID 1721. Also can't resize header after sorting like that
-Add refresh button to reset table sort
-Export to CSV is seperating timestamps, it's using date,time. Need to export them in a single column, seperated by a space
-SDID with MRID in them are not running through data dictionary properly, which means they are not getting proper headers
-Column resize doesn't seem to work until 2nd query

####### GIT MODIFICATIONS #######
-Figure out why __pycache__ is not being ignored
-Create a system that allows for test branches, staging, etc. This will make it easier when codeing team gets bigger
-Update readme
-Need documentation on different installers and pre req, maybe add in wiki or readme
-Provide links to stuff like requesting USGS API key, Reclamation website, USGS data browser, and documention on how to find USGS information to create dataID

####### USGS API REVAMP #######
-Rename current apiRead to apiReadOldMethod
-New apiRead needs to use USGS new method of API key authenticaiton method
-Need to setup logic to allow a query without the API key if none are in the system
-Need a fallback for new method not working, due to different stages in their development, to run apiReadOldMethod instead

####### HOUSE KEEPING #######
-Logging and debugging, best practices
    -Any current [DEBUG] after an exception should be a ERROR and logged, no matter if DEBUG = true
-Save dialog for CSV needs wider columns or auto size needs to be fixed (linux is fine)
-Break apart Logic.py into more .py files based on type of logic
-Export to CSV needs work. Remembering path isn't working across platform, possibly Qt issue. Lots of trial and error code left in there, needs to be removed when completed

####### NEW FEATURES #######
-Create a plot tool that allows users to build different data plots and save that plot config as a quick look
    -This can be done with below parker/davis stretch also. Create a plot that finds travel times in a given stretch, based on user input. Below parker or davis would be saved as quick looks in this tool

####### MAIN INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Stress relief button that makes screaming goat sounds

####### OPTIONS INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Check boxes need to be adjusted
    -Retro Mode and Quality Control Checks : is cut off
    -All check boxes are too low
    -Raw data spacing from : to the check box is ideal, make others fit this

####### QUERY WINDOW MODIFICATIONS #######
-Create a search icon next to dataID, this will need to bring up a window with a search. Allow user to search data dictionary, then hit add to query
    -Search will need a combobox to allow the user to search by dataID, label, or database
-Add up and down arrows to reorganize items in the query list. Can add a move 1, move 5, move Max
-Add a checkbox to do a delta check between pairs of data
    -Make it simple and require the user to put data in order in the query list. Difference will be between 1 & 2, 3 & 4
    -Difference will show up in column to the right of the pair, with special QAQC checks and will not go through normal QAQC

####### QUERY ENHANCEMENTS MODIFICATIONS #######
-Build a limiter into Aquarius to cut data queries down into 500 points per query
-Bug in header width calculation when formatting adds extra characters that were not taken into account for header width
    -A simple fix could be make the min width fit 000.00. I don't think this bug will come up often if that min is set
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json
    -Need to combine aquarius parameters to HDB data types for formatting rules
-modify and test for day, month, year, and water year queries

####### GIT MODIFICATIONS BEFORE 3.0 RELASE #######
-Update readme
-Need documentation on different installers and pre req, maybe add in wiki or readme
-Provide links to stuff like requesting USGS API key, Reclamation website, USGS data browser, and documention on how to find USGS information to create dataID

####### HOUSE KEEPING #######
-Logging and debugging, best practices
    -Any current [DEBUG] after an exception should be a ERROR and logged, no matter if DEBUG = true
-Save dialog for CSV needs wider columns or auto size needs to be fixed (linux is fine)
-Break apart Logic.py into more .py files based on type of logic
-Export to CSV needs work. Remembering path isn't working across platform, possibly Qt issue. Lots of trial and error code left in there, needs to be removed when completed
-Remove any unused imports and def

####### NEW FEATURES #######
-Create a plot tool that allows users to build different data plots and save that plot config as a quick look
    -This can be done with below parker/davis stretch also. Create a plot that finds travel times in a given stretch, based on user input. Below parker or davis would be saved as quick looks in this tool

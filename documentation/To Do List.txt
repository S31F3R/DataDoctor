####### HOUSE KEEPING #######
-Logging and debugging, best practices
    -Any current [DEBUG] after an exception should be a ERROR and logged, no matter if DEBUG = true
-Save dialog for CSV needs wider columns or auto size needs to be fixed (linux is fine)
-Break apart Logic.py into more .py files based on type of logic
-Export to CSV needs work. Remembering path isn't working across platform, possibly Qt issue. Lots of trial and error code left in there, needs to be removed when completed

####### NEW FEATURES #######
-Create a plot tool that allows users to build different data plots and save that plot config as a quick look
    -This can be done with below parker/davis stretch also. Create a plot that finds travel times in a given stretch, based on user input. Below parker or davis would be saved as quick looks in this tool

####### MAIN INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Stress relief button that makes screaming goat sounds

####### QUERY WINDOW MODIFICATIONS #######
-Create a search icon next to dataID, this will need to bring up a window with a search. Allow user to search data dictionary, then hit add to query
    -Search will need a combobox to allow the user to search by dataID, label, or database
-Add up and down arrows to reorganize items in the query list. Can add a move 1, move 5, move Max

####### QUERY ENHANCEMENTS MODIFICATIONS #######
-Aquarius query seems to take longer than it should. Look at possible threading solutions
    -If increasing Aquarius threads, make it an option to set how many threads can be used
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end    
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json
-modify and test for day, month, year, and water year queries
-See if there is a better way to get around unverified cert when using HTTPS on Aquarius query

####### GIT MODIFICATIONS BEFORE 3.0 RELASE #######
-Update readme
-Need documentation on different installers and pre req, maybe add in wiki or readme
-Provide links to stuff like requesting USGS API key, Reclamation website, USGS data browser, and documention on how to find USGS information to create dataID

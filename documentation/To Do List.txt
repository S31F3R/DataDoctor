####### MAIN INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######

    -If increasing Aquarius threads, make it an option to set how many threads can be used
    -Add query limiter as an option
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end
    -Add USBR/USGS query limiter as an option in respective sections
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json

####### QUERY INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######

    -Two day set to beginning of previous day to current day current hour

####### DATA TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Query window sized needs to stay fixed, basically no max button
-Table first column doesn't adjust size to fit data AND header after clicking header to sort. Header is truncated on SDID 1721. Also can't resize header after sorting like that
-Add refresh button to reset table sort
-Export to CSV is seperating timestamps, it's using date,time. Need to export them in a single column, seperated by a space
-SDID with MRID in them are not running through data dictionary properly, which means they are not getting proper headers

-DataDictionary table needs to auto size columns
-DataDictionary needs sort, similar to the date table sort
-Buttons need to run through button logic

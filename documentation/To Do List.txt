####### MAIN INTERFACE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Stress relief button that makes screaming goat sounds

####### QUERY ENHANCMENTS MODIFICATIONS #######
-Aquarius query seems to take longer than it should. Look at possible threading solutions
    -If increasing Aquarius threads, make it an option to set how many threads can be used
-Have USBR, USGS, Aquarius queries all run at the same time and collect at the end    
-Formatting rules need to come from a file in the program, generated by the rules in Aquarius
    -Set to 2 decimals for now
    -Look into Aquarius query to pull value percision each query to get fresh rules
        -/AQUARIUS/Publish/v2/GetParameterList?format=json
-non data dictionary dataID should still run through missing and repeating
-modify and test for day, month, year, and water year queries

####### DATA TABLE MODIFICATIONS #######
-Table first column doesn't adjust size to fit data AND header after clicking header to sort. Header is truncated on SDID 1721. Also can't resize header after sorting like that
-Add refresh button to reset table sort
-Export to CSV is seperating timestamps, it's using date,time. Need to export them in a single column, seperated by a space
-SDID with MRID in them are not running through data dictionary properly, which means they are not getting proper headers
